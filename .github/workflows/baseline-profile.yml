# Environment variables (Optional)
# Small projects might have signingConfigs locally. This could lead to failures on GitHub Actions.
# If that's the case, upload your properties defined locally to GitHub Secrets.

# On your signingConfigs, you can recover GitHub Secrets using: variable = System.getenv("VARIABLE")

# Then uncomment this block properly defining your uploaded variables
# env:
#  VARIABLE: ${{ secrets.VARIABLE }}
